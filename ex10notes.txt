Exercise 10: What Was That?

in Exercise 9 I threw you some new stuff, just to keep you on your toes.
I showed you two ways to make a string that goes across multiple lines.
In the first way, I put the characters \n (backslash n) between the names of
the months. These two characters put a new line character into the string at
that point.

This \ (backslash) character encodes difficult-to-type characters into a string.
There are various "escape sequences" available for different characters you
might want to use. We'll try a few of these sequences so you can see what I
mean.

An important escape sequence is to escape a single-quote ' or double-quote ".
Imagine you have a string that uses double-quotes and you want to put a
double-quote inside the string. If you write "I "understand" joe." then
Python will get confused because it will think the " around "understand"
actually ends the string. You need a way to tell Python that the " inside
the string isn't a real double-quote.

To solve this problem you escape double-quotes and single-quotes so
Python knows to include in the string. Here's an example:

"I am 6'2\" tall."  # escape double-quote inside string
'I am 6\'2" tall.'  # escape single-quote inside string
